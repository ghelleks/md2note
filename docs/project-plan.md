# Project Plan: Python Markdown to Apple Notes Application

## Overview
This project plan outlines the phases and deliverables required to implement an MVP for a Python application that processes markdown files, calls AppleScript to create notes in Apple Notes, preserves metadata, and manages file movement and error handling.

---

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Requirements Validation ✅
**Deliverables:**
- Confirmed requirements document
- Project repository initialized with version control
- Directory structure for source code, tests, and documentation

**Status: COMPLETE**

---

## Phase 2: Core Functionality Implementation
### 2.1 Directory Scanning & File Handling
**Deliverables:**
- Python code to select and scan a directory for markdown files
- Unit tests for directory scanning and file listing

### 2.2 Markdown Parsing & Metadata Extraction
**Deliverables:**
- Python script to parse markdown files and extract metadata (YAML front matter, file properties)
- Unit tests for metadata extraction and parsing logic

### 2.3 Note Creation in Apple Notes via AppleScript
**Deliverables:**
- Python code to call AppleScript for creating a new note in Apple Notes with content and metadata
- Unit tests for note creation logic (mocked where possible)

### 2.4 File Movement on Success
**Deliverables:**
- Python script to move processed files to a 'clean' subdirectory
- Unit tests for file movement and error handling

---

## Phase 3: Error Handling & User Interaction
**Deliverables:**
- Error detection and reporting in Python
- User prompts for additional information or to quit on error
- Unit tests for error handling and user prompt logic

---

## Phase 4: Integration & End-to-End Testing
**Deliverables:**
- Integration tests covering the full workflow: directory scan → parse → note creation → file move
- Test cases for both successful and failure scenarios
- Documentation of test results

---

## Phase 5: Documentation & MVP Release
**Deliverables:**
- User guide for running the application
- Developer guide for code structure and testing
- Final MVP release package (source code, tests, documentation)

---

## Testing Summary
- **Unit Tests:** Directory scanning, markdown parsing, metadata extraction, note creation (mocked), file movement, error handling
- **Integration Tests:** End-to-end workflow, error scenarios, user prompts
